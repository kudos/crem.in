Over the last day I've put together two PHP5 API classes (loosely termed, it's screen scraping at heart) for online services I use, AIB online banking and Three's newly launched webtexts. I'm releasing both under the LGPL license and you can find them in my [open source releases](https://crem.in/releases) directory.
