In a follow up from my recent <a href="http://jonathancremin.com/2009/06/15/aib-and-three-webtext-php5-apis/">release of an API</a> to <a href="http://webtext.three.ie">Three mobile's new web texts</a>, I decided
to make an accessible interface for myself.

Being a Mac user, the quickest way to make this happen was through the dashboard. It's terribly basic right now, with only two hours or so put into it so far, but it's very usable.

You can get it from <a href="/releases">my releases</a> directory.
