A support ticket came in yesterday at [Minthost](https://minthost.com). A customer wanted to upgrade from an entry package to a Large reseller package. Out of interest, I wondered what kind of site would need those resources but not have hit my radar before. What I saw was unexpected, I immediately recognised a hack job rip off of [Localhostr](http://localhostr.com), another site of mine.

<a style="float:right; margin-left: 20px; width: 200px;" href="./images/ripoff.png"><img src="./images/ripoff-thumb.png" /></a>

After going back to look at the rip off again later, I thought I recognised the footer style. It was Minthost's. But that wasn't all, the header too was lifted from Minthost, which meant that the entire site was hacked together from my intellectual property.

I already had most of the culprit's personal details, and after visiting his personal site (probably a rip off too) I discovered that he's just a 17 year old swedish kid. I fired off an email, a bit less harsh than it might have been had I thought he was more malicious than stupid.

A reply came in a couple of hours later.

I did not have, and do not have any intention of using your content for anything other than educational purposes, I was simply analyzing your practices and learning how to use them myself.

He pulled the site offline right after that. I think I can accept his story, though I hope he doesn't repeat it in the future. I've kept his name out of this as he's young and it's not my intention to tarnish it. (You could figure it out from the screenshot, but that's not going to get indexed by search engines)

The take away from this for me for now is positive, I designed something worth stealing.
