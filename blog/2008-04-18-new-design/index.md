I just threw together my first wordpress theme. It's inspired by one of [Upstart Blogger](http://www.upstartblogger.com/)'s themes, but coded and designed entirely by myself in about 2 hours total. The photo is one I took last summer driving through Arizona, with my head out the window doing 100mph ;)
