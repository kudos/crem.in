[Digitarald](http://digitarald.de) has updated his [FancyUpload](http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/) script to version 2. I used his first version as the uploader on Localhostr and I think I might just update it to use this one.

With the original I had to hack together some json support but it seems this is the default behaviour of the latest release. I love this guy's work and you should check out the [other projects](http://digitarald.de/projects/) he has, all of which are built on the fantastic [mootools](http://mootools.net). I particularly like [Roar](http://digitarald.de/project/roar/) notifications which is inspired by Growl, the notification system for Mac OS X.
