I have a load of things I'd like to be working on, so many that I lose track and end up forgetting most of them. It's not quite the new year yet, but here's a short list of things I'd like to accomplish (in no particular order) in 2011:

* Push the Localhostr alpha site and API live.
* Finish the Localhostr Mac app, and write an Android one.
* Launch the [Minthost](http://minthost.com) redesign that I have tucked away, together with SolusVM VPS offerings.
* Build a content-rich site for Irish cinema listings using [themoviedb.org](http://themoviedb.org)'s lovely API and hi-res images.
* Write a PHP PECL Git extension, as much for the experience as the need for one.
* Build myself a nice Git-based deployment system for [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org/) — like apps in the spirit of [Heroku](http://heroku.com)'s method

I'll probably add to this list in the run up to the new year, but that'll do for now ;)

I'm under no illusion that I can get all of this done but any small part of it would be nice. What awesome plans have you got on the long finger?
