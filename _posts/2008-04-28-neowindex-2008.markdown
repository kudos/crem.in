<a href="http://services.neowin.net/live/">Neowindex</a> is the name given to gatherings of <a href="http://neowin.net">Neowin</a> staff and members. This years brought me and 6 other staffers to Haarlem and about 8 more to Seattle last weekend.

The guys in Seattle got tours of Microsoft, Valve and the ship from Deadliest Catch, a Discovery Channel show. They got a preview of the new TF2 Map "Goldrush" and got to play it against the guys who made it, the lucky bastards :P .

Meanwhile, in Haarlem/Amsterdam we did a whole lot of drinking and sight-seeing (mainly drinking ;) ). It was great to put faces to the names and to get to know the guys personally, they really are a great bunch! We had Chris Aarons of <a href="http://buzzcorps.com/">Buzzcorp</a> join us on our escapades also, a really nice guy and he's going to be helping us with an upcoming giveaway on Neowin.
