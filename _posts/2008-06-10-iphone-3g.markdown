I'm sure you've all heard about the new iPhone by now, with 3G and GPS built in it's finally a phone I want. It's going to be available in Ireland through O2 costing &euro;169 on their lowest plan (&euro;49/m) and will be in shops on the 11th of July. The full price plans are as follows:

<table>	
<tr><td></td><td>iPhone 175</td><td>iPhone 350</td><td>iPhone 700</td></tr>
<tr><td>8 GB 3G iPhone</td><td>&euro;169</td><td>&euro;99</td><td>&euro;49</td></tr>
<tr><td>16 GB 3G iPhone</td><td>&euro;229</td><td>&euro;169</td><td>&euro;129</td></tr>
<tr><td>Monthly tariff</td><td>&euro;45</td><td>&euro;65</td><td>&euro;100</td></tr>
<tr><td>Anytime minutes included *</td><td>175</td><td>350</td><td>700</td></tr>
<tr><td>Texts included *</td><td>100</td><td>150</td><td>250</td></tr>
<tr><td>Data**</td><td>1GB</td><td>1GB</td><td>1GB</td></tr>

I didn't understand the hype of the first iPhone release, but they certainly have me caught up in it this time.
