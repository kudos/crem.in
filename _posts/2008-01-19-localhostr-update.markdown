It’s been a long time coming, but I’ve finally put a <a href="http://localhostr.com">localhostr</a> update live. Pretty much everything has changed, first there’s a javascript/flash uploader with multiple files and a progress bar. Then there’s the new file naming system, gone are the gibberish urls, replaced with slightly stripped (for security) real file names. And there’s the completely rewritten codebase. It’s built on codeigniter, though I expect to be moving the downloader to raw PHP to take pressure off the servers. Did I mention how sexy it looks now? :P
