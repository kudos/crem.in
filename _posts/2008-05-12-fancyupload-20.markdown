<a href="http://digitarald.de">Digitarald</a> has updated his <a href="http://digitarald.de/project/fancyupload/">FancyUpload</a> script to version 2. I used his first version as the uploader on Localhostr and I think I might just update it to use this one.

With the original I had to hack together some json support but it seems this is the default behaviour of the latest release. I love this guy's work and you should check out the <a href="http://digitarald.de/projects/">other projects</a> he has, all of which are built on the fantastic <a href="http://mootools.net">mootools</a>. I particularly like <a href="http://digitarald.de/project/roar/">Roar</a> notifications which is inspired by Growl, the notification system for Mac OS X.
