Back in June <a href="http://simon360.com">simon360</a> released his dashboard widget for uploading files to localhostr. Earlier this month <a href="http://mjpa.co.uk">Mike</a> released a windows desktop app which does much the same. Both of them use <a href="http://mail.minthoster.com/">mail's</a> awesome design. They have teamed up and launched a single site that you can get them both from, <a href="http://localhostruploadr.com">localhostruploadr</a>.
