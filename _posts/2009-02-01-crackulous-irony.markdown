I just received this email and found it to be the picture of irony. To get you up to speed (I'd never heard of it either), "Crackulous" is an iPhone app that allows people to crack other apps for use on jailbroken iPhones. In short, it's an app for pirating iPhone apps.

<blockquote><p>The copyrighted iPhone application Crackulous is hosted on the Localhostr servers at the URL mentioned below. In this instance, said materials are works of the mind and are thus copyrighted as per the Copyright Berne Convention of 1988. Additionally, a copyright notice is displayed to the user both upon obtaining said file, when they start the application for the first time, and in the about screen.</p>

The file named above <a href="http://www.funkyspacemonkey.com/crackulous-cancelled">contains the source code</a> for "Crackulous". It seems Mr. Shahar AKA SaladFork is ok with his app being used to breach the copyrights of others. The source code is available all over file hosting sites and he's probably now sending out DMCAs en masse because a public beta of the app has <a href="http://hackulo.us/forums/index.php?showtopic=12255">just been released</a>.
