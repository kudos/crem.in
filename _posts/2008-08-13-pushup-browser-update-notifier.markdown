Every developer out there is sick to death of the mostrosity that is IE6. As part of a movement to "push" users up from out-dated browsers, <a title="pushuptheweb" href="http://pushuptheweb.com" target="_blank">pushup</a> is a little script to automatically notify those users and provide them with a link to update their browser.

If you've visited this site on an older browser (extremely few do), you would aready have received a notification for this ;)
