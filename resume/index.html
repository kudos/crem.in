			<h2>Personal Projects</h2>

			<h3><a href="https://hostr.co">Hostr</a></h3>
			<p>With a slick interface, serving up millions of downloads daily and over a hundred thousand registered users, Hostr provides a quick and easy way to share files.
			This was a side project I started in 2006.
			It's been through half a dozen total rewrites in 3 languages since then.
			I use it as a testbed for new tech I want to play around with.
			I've also built a companion Mac menu bar app with Cocoa/Obj-C.</p>
			
			<h3><a href="https://match.audio">Match Audio</a></h3>
			<p>Match Audio takes links from various music subscription services and returns a page containing matching links to all other services to allow broader sharing.
				I started this in December 2014 as an excuse to build something isomorphically with React.
				It has been developed from the beginning as an open source project.</p>

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/kudos" class="screen">Github</a><a href="https://github.com/kudos" class="print">Github</a></h3>
			<p>I've published some other small projects on Github, including Python, NodeJS and PHP libraries. I have also contributed back to a number of other projects via Github.</p>
