Yusuke Kamiyamane has released another free icon pack called [Fugue](http://pinvoke.com) to follow up his other great Diagona pack. Both these packs make a great alternative to using the beaten-to-death [famfamfam silk](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/) icon pack.

*Update:* This guy is a machine, he's now at 2,800 icons in this amazing pack
